# Claude Code Multi Agent Observability

## Instructions
> Follow these instructions as you work through the project.

### REMEMBER: Use source_app + session_id to uniquely identify an agent.

Every hook event will include a source_app and session_id. Use these to uniquely identify an agent.
For display purposes, we want to show the agent ID as "source_app:session_id" with session_id truncated to the first 8 characters.

## Stack
- **Server**: Bun + SQLite (WAL mode)
